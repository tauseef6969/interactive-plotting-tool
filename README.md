# Interactive Data Visualization Tool

This is a Python-based tool for creating interactive data visualizations using the Plotly library. With this tool, you can create a wide range of charts, such as line charts, scatter plots, bar charts, and more, and customize their appearance to your needs.

## Installation

To use this tool, you will need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have installed Python, you can install the required dependencies.

## Usage

To use the tool, simply run the `main.py` script in your terminal: 
python main.py


This will launch the tool's user interface, where you can select a data file, choose a chart type, and customize the chart's appearance. You can zoom in on specific data points, hover over them to see more information, and save the chart as an image for later use.

The tool comes with sample data files that you can use to test its functionality. You can also provide your own data files in CSV or Excel format, as long as they follow the same structure as the sample files.
